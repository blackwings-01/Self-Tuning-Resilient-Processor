Self-Tuning-Resilient-Processor
===============================

The goal of our project is to implement error correcting circuitry in a standard 5-stage 
pipelined processor in order to operate at higher frequencies without compromising power 
and guaranteeing the correct result. This project seeks to replicate the results of the 
Resilient Power-Tuning Schemes proposed by Intelâ€™s Architecture Group. While this group 
factored in temperature and voltage conditions into the dynamic events that cause errors, 
we are only looking at how to detect and overcome the errors and performance losses that 
are induced by overclocking in conventional pipelined processors.
